# THP W6D3 - The Return of the revenge of the Gossip Project !

## Content

Here below are some of the stuff you may want to cover while browsing this Ruby on Rail (RoR) project :

* Migrations, schema, seeds and dedicated SQL script (to delete table content more easily despite constraints) - See _/db/_

* Corresponding models and relations - See _/app/models/_

* Configuration (incl. 'routes.rb', 'database.yml' initialized for PostegreSQL...) - See related files in the _/config/_ directory

* Controllers - See _/app/controllers/_

* Views and layouts - See _/app/views/_ sub-directories. In particular, _/app/views/layouts/_ gathers the header / footer templating.

Enjoy, _wanderer_ :wink: !
